# landing_page
Let's create my first landing page!

Started by creating the html file and adding the boiler plate. In the body, I started by creating the header
to us the top down method. I looked back at flex assignment 3 & 7 to get an idea of how to create the header in the html file. The links just go to google for now (might change later).

After inputting the information I wanted in my header, I started messing with the css just to find out if I was able to move the different items to where I wanted on the page. There is a very good chance that I will have to go back to edit later.
